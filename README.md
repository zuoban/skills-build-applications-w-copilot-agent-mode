_Build an application with GitHub Copilot agent mode in less than an hour._

## Welcome

People love how GitHub Copilot helps them write code faster and with fewer errors.
But what if GitHub could create a full stack application for your job role based on requirements
written in natural language.
In this exercise, we will prompt GitHub Copilot agent mode to create us a complete application.

- **Who is this for**: Intermediate developers familiar with GitHub Copilot, basic GitHub, and basic web development
- **What you'll learn**: We'll introduce GitHub Copilot agent mode and how to use it for application development.
- **What you'll build**: You'll use GitHub Copilot agent mode to create a fitness application as the gym teacher of a high school.
- **How long**: This course takes less than one hour to complete.

In this exercise, you will:

1. Start up a preconfigured development environment for making a full stack application.
2. Prompt in GitHub Copilot Chat and select the edit tab and select agent mode from the edit/agent drop down.
3. Try creating the application with GPT-4o.
4. Try other LLM models to see other output.
