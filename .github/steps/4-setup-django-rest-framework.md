## Step 4: Setup Django REST Framework, start the server, and test the API

In this step, we will accomplish the following:

- Setup the Django REST Framework.
- Start the server.
- Test the API using curl.

1. Open all files in the `docs` folder and keep this file open in the editor throughout this exercise.
    1.  agent mode uses `mona-high-school-fitness-tracker.md` and `octofit_story.md` as a reference to create the application
2. Copy and paste the following prompt(s) in the GitHub Copilot Chat and select the "Agent" instead of "Ask" or "Edit" from the drop down where you are inserting the prompt.

> ü™ß **Note:** 
- Do not change the model from GPT-4o this will be an optional activity at the end of the course.
- Keep in mind that the Copilot agent mode is conversational so it may ask you questions and you can ask it questions too.
- Wait a moment for the Copilot to respond and press the continue button to execute commands presented by Copilot agent mode.
- Keep files created and updated by Copilot agent mode until it is finished.
- Agent mode has the ability to evaluate your code base and execute commands and add/refactor/delete parts of your code base and automatically self heal if it or you makes a mistake in the process.

> ü™ß **Note:** 
- Make sure to replace [REPLACE-THIS-WITH-YOUR-CODESPACE-NAME] with your codespace name.
  - ex. redesigned-spork-g6pj46rr9hpp6x
- You can get the codespace name by running the following command in the terminal: `echo $CODESPACE_NAME`.

> ```prompt
>Based on the example monafit tracker app in the docs/mona-high-school-fitness-tracker.md file and use octofit as the name for Mergington's high school's app. Let's setup codespace for the URL, start the server via VS Code launch.json, and test the API.
> 
> 1. Activate the Python virtual environment.
> 2. Update #file:octofit-tracker/backend/octofit_tracker/views.py to replace the return for the REST API URL endpoints with the codespace URL https://[REPLACE-THIS-WITH-YOUR-CODESPACE-NAME]-8000.app.github.dev for Django and avoid certificate HTTPS issues.
> 3. Make sure the Django backend works on [REPLACE-THIS-WITH-YOUR-CODESPACE-NAME]-8000.app.github.dev and localhost:8000.
> 4. Test the API endpoints using curl command.
> 5. Allow host access to codespace URL and localhost:8000.
>
> Don't proceed with the next activity until all of these steps are completed.
>```

> ‚ùï **Important:** Don't start the Python Django app in the way that GitHub Copilot agent mode suggests hit **cancel**. Follow the next activity instead.

### :keyboard: Activity: Start the Python Django app and check the output
Now, let's actually try running the Django application! In the left sidebar, select the `Run and Debug` tab and then press the **Start Debugging** icon.

1. Now that we have updated our Django product to include our codespace name for the URL endpoint,
   let's check our changes in to our `build-octofit-app` branch.

1. With our new changes complete, please **commit** and **push** the changes to GitHub.

1. Wait a moment for Mona to check your work, provide feedback, and share the next lesson so we can keep working!

<summary>Having trouble? ü§∑</summary><br/>

If you don't get feedback, here are some things to check:

- Make sure your commit changes were made for the following files to the branch `build-octofit-app` and pushed/synchronized to GitHub:
  - `octofit-tracker/backend/octofit_tracker/settings.py`
  - `octofit-tracker/backend/octofit_tracker/views.py`
- If Mona found a mistake, simply make a correction and push your changes again. Mona will check your work as many times as needed.
