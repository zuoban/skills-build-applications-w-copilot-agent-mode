## Step 5: Setup the frontend React framework, update the components, and start OctoFit Tracker app

In this step, we will accomplish the following:

- Setup the octofit-tracker frontend React framework.
- Update the following components to include the React framework:
  - src/App.js
  - src/index.js
  - src/components/Activities.js
  - src/components/Leaderboard.js
  - src/components/Teams.js
  - src/components/Users.js
  - src/components/Workouts.js
- Start the React app and check the output.

1. Open all files in the `docs` folder and keep this file open in the editor throughout this exercise.
    1.  agent mode uses `mona-high-school-fitness-tracker.md` and `octofit_story.md` as a reference to create the application
2. Copy and paste the following prompt(s) in the GitHub Copilot Chat and select the "Agent" instead of "Ask" or "Edit" from the drop down where you are inserting the prompt.

> ü™ß **Note:** 
- Do not change the model from GPT-4o this will be an optional activity at the end of the course.
- Keep in mind that the Copilot agent mode is conversational so it may ask you questions and you can ask it questions too.
- Wait a moment for the Copilot to respond and press the continue button to execute commands presented by Copilot agent mode.
- Keep files created and updated by Copilot agent mode until it is finished.
- Agent mode has the ability to evaluate your code base and execute commands and add/refactor/delete parts of your code base and automatically self heal if it or you makes a mistake in the process.

### :keyboard: Activity: Update the octofit-tracker frontend React components

> ü™ß **Note:** 
- Make sure to replace [REPLACE-THIS-WITH-YOUR-CODESPACE-NAME] with your codespace name.
  - ex. redesigned-spork-g6pj46rr9hpp6x
- You can get the codespace name by running the following command in the terminal: `echo $CODESPACE_NAME`.

>
> - Update the following components to include the React framework to point to the backend API:
>   - src/App.js
>   - src/index.js
>   - src/components/Activities.js
>   - src/components/Leaderboard.js
>   - src/components/Teams.js
>   - src/components/Users.js
>   - src/components/Workouts.js
> - In each component replace the fetch url with the codespace url https://[REPLACE-THIS-WITH-YOUR-CODESPACE-NAME]-8000.app.github.dev/api/<component> for the Django rest framework backend.
> - Make sure to use the correct port and protocol http or https.
> - Update src/App.js to include the main navigation for all components.
> - Make sure react-router-dom is used for the navigation menu.
> - The react app should show the navigation menu and the components.
>
> Don't proceed with the next activity until all of these steps are completed.

- Make sure to replace [REPLACE-THIS-WITH-YOUR-CODESPACE-NAME] with your codespace name.
  - ex. redesigned-spork-g6pj46rr9hpp6x
- You can get the codespace name by running the following command in the terminal: `echo $CODESPACE_NAME`.

### :keyboard: Activity: Start the react app and check the output

Now, let's actually try running the react application! In the left sidebar, select the `Run and Debug` tab and then press the **Start Debugging** icon.

### :keyboard: Optional Activity: Iterate on the appearance and try different models

> üß™ **Try this:**
- Try creating your own prompts to change the application appearance, add features, and try different models.
- Once you are happy with the application you can commit the changes and push them to your branch `build-octofit-app`.

1. Now that we have created the REACT frontend for all application components let's check our changes in to our `build-octofit-app` branch.

1. With our new changes complete, please **commit** and **push** the changes to GitHub.

1. Wait a moment for Mona to check your work, provide feedback, and share the next lesson so we can keep working!
